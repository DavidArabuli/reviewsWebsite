 - core is ready, basic registration\login, posting articles, editing articles etc.


- TODO
 1) Steam API integration 
  - once article is created Steam API should be contacted 
    and all the data for that game should be pulled - game screenshots, score, PC reqs etc.
    -  game Steam ID could be provided when article is posted
    -  alternatively, it could be a process of storing all the data beforehand, assuming, 
       that games that are going to be reviewed are known already.
 2) Upload screenshots (jpg, png files) to attach to the article
 3) Add website`s review score fields 
 4) relevant youtube video field (for trailers etc)
 5) ability to sort "All Reviews" according to score
 6) ability to filter "All Reviews" according to genre tags

 8) admin dashboard 
 9) editor role
